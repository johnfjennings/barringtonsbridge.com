        <p>M atthew Barrington (1 788-1861) was the eldest son of Joseph Barrington (1 764- 1846). The latter was knighted in 1831, becoming Sir Joseph, succeeding to a title which was created in 1611, when Sir Francis Barrington was given a baronetcy by King James 1st of England. The first of the Limerick Barringtons was Francis, who came to Ireland with his cousin, Sir John Barrington. John served in Cromwell's army, and received grants of land. </p><p></p>
        <p>Francis settled in Limerick and was buried in St. Mary's Cathedral in 1683. It is generally accepted that Francis had a son, Samuel, known familiarly as 'Little Sam Barrington'. He was living in Dublin, in St. Michan's parish, with his wife and family, from, 1665 to 1674.") In the parish register of St. Michan's, he is usually described as a 'smith', but he is once termed a 'jack-smith', which would indicate that he was a maker of the clockwork roasting 'jacks', used for operating clocks at the time.") He may be identified with the Samuel Barrington who had a contract for the maintenance of the Tholsel Clock in Dublin.'" On arriving in Limerick, he set up a business as a 'clock and chime maker'.</p>
      <p>However, he died two years later, in 1693, as can be seen from the inscription on his tomb in St. Mary's Cathedral, Limerick, which runs as follows: 'Memento Mory. Here lieth littell Samuel1 Barington, that great undertaker of famous cittis clock and chime maker. He made his one time goe early and latter, but now he is returned to God his creator: the 19 of November, then he pleast and for his memory this here is placed by his son Ben. 1693. '4 Benjamin carried on his father's business in Limerick, extending it considerably. He had a contract with the Corporation of Cashel, Co. Tipperary, for fitting up and making a clock for the sum of five pounds.(" Along with clock-making, he also ran a copper foundry. He became Sheriff of Limerick in 171 4, and later was made an Alderman. His son was also called Benjamin, and likewise became Sheriff of Limerick, in 1729. This last Benjamin had four sons, Matthew, Croker, John and Benjamin, all of whom became freemen of the City of Limerick.</p><p>The eldest son, Matthew, had two children, a daughter Mary, and a son, Joseph. Joseph, who became a freeman in 181 9, was the father of Sir Matthew. The future Sir Matthew was born in Limerick on 21 May, 1788, and baptised in St. Mary's parish. By any standards, Matthew was an outstanding man. He broke away from the family clock-making business, and trained as a lawyer. While keeping his contacts with Limerick, his native city, he spent much of his time in Dublin, building up a practice as a solicitor. He had his office in 13 Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, and another in George's Street, Limerick. When only twenty-six years of age, he was offered the post of Crown-Solicitor for Munster, from the previous holder of the office, Samuel Prendergast, who was forced to retire through ill-health.") The salary of the Crown-Solicitor was f 15,000 a year, and his duties covered the counties of Limerick, Cork, Tipperary, Kerry and Clare, where he handled all legal business for the government</p>
           <p>Matthew Barrington was to be their benefactor if not, indeed, their The first concrete evidence we have of Matthew Barrington taking an interest in the Carbery estate is the bridge which he constructed over the River Mulcair, and which was called 'Barrington's Bridge'. An inscription on the bridge, which is constructed of iron, and is still in use, reads: 'Erected by M. Barrington, 1818'. The next piece of evidence is the correspondence carried out during Augu,skto November, 181 8, between Matthew Barrington and Bartholomew Stritch. On 17 August, 181 8, Matthew Barrington wrote to Stritch, then in London: 'May I request of you to attend to the following matter for me while you remain in London. I shall not make an apology to you for the trouble, as I am convinced I need only tell you that it is a subject in which I am much interested. </p>
          <p>The late Lord Corbery, who lived at Laxton, in Northamptonshire, England, and died in 1804, made his will in that year, leaving his Irish estates to his wife's jointure of £2,000 a year. May I ask you to find out the legatees, and make a bargain for me with them. 'l0] Stritch replied in two letters, dated 29 August and 1 October, 1818, giving the results of his enquiries.'"' The main problem was the absence of Lady Carbery - the widow of the late 4th Lord Carbery - in France. However, Matthew Barrington went ahead with his plans to buy the Carbery estate, though he had to do so first of all by offering to lease some of the property. This was done by a deed, dated 11 December, 1818, by which he leased Cappercullen, Garranbane, Glenstal, Meentolla, etc. for annual rent of 2 1 50</p><p>It was a very prestigious position, apart from being lucrative. That same year of 1814, when he became Crown Solicitor for Munster, Matthew married Charlotte Hartigan, daughter of William Hartigan, of Dublin, a medical doctor and professor of anatomy at Trinity College, Dublin. The marriage was celebrated on 1 January, 181 4, in St. George's parish, Dublin. She brought him a very considerable dowry, as can be seen from the 'settlement' or 'agreement', dated 24 December, 181 3, entitled 'The Settlement On the Intermarriage of Matthew Barrington with Miss Charlotte Hartigan'.'" The dowry consisted of a large piece of land in the barony of
Connelloe, Co. Limerick, as well as a sum of money in excess of 22,000. This acquisition of land in Co. Limerick - the first owned by a Barrington - seems to have given Matthew great satisfaction. Indeed, it whetted his appetite to acquire more. land. Sometime in 1818, Matthew's eye fell on a large estate in east Limerick, which had originally belonged to Lord Carbery, who died in December, 1804. </p><p>The estate had become heavily encumbered, and when the 5th Lord Carbery succeeded to the title in 1804, he found that the rents of the property in Co. Limerick hardly sufficed to pay the £2,000 income left to the widow of his predecessor. In any case, he only lived three years to enjoy his title, and was in turn succeeded by a cousin, Sir John Evens Freke, of Castle Freke, Co. Cork, who became the 6th Lord Carbery. The daughters of the 5th Lord Carbery claimed a share in the rents of the Co. Limerick estate, but what with mortgages, legacies and the payment of interest on loans, they could not expect very much by way of actual money. They lived in Cappercullen House, in the parish of Abington (Murroe), Co. Limerick, and awaited for some good fortune to come their way

        <p>This site is a digital archive of the history of Barrington bridge and also a commemoration to its 200th anniversary</p>
        <p>Located approximately 14km / 8 miles from Limerick City on the road from Limerick to Abington where it spans the Mulcair River this 'elegant bridge of one arch of cast iron from which the village derives its name, 'l was commissioned by Matthew Barrington in 1818. He sought the assistance of Limerick Iron Foundries which were by this time trading as James Doyle and Company. Doyle had established the foundry in 1806. Twelve years later 'the company was producing a wide range of iron products including hydraulic engines, stoves, etc. However, the most notable product of the foundry was the iron bridge known as Barrington's Bridge which was cast in 1818. Over 53 feet (16.15 m) long, it was the first iron road bridge to be turned out by an Irish foundry'2</p>
      <p>Barrington's Bridge is a 'single span cast iron and limestone road bridge having nine curved cast iron pipes of 12-inch (30.5 cm) diameter supporting the roadway. The pipes were cast in sections and later bolted together using flanged joints. This bridge includes cast-iron balustrades with scrolled brackets, lettering, quatrefoil motifs and a pair of square-profile limestone piers to east and west. The cast iron sides ofthe bridge are decorated neatly and bear the name of Matthew Banington in the centre of the bridge and that of the maker, J. Doyle, on the sides.3 Though now no longer in use, Barrington's Bridge was built with high-quality materials and serves as a reminder of the quality of nineteenthcentury engineering craftsmanship'4.</p><p>Matthew Barrington, whose name adorns the bridge was born in Limerick in May 1788. He became a solicitor and in 1814 became Crown Solicitor for Munster. That same year he matTied Charlotte Hartigan whose dowry consisted a large tract of land in the Barony ofConnello, Co. Limerick as well as €2,000.</p><p>Four years later, Matthew became interested in an estate in East Limerick which originally belonged to Lord Carbery. It was then he had this bridge constructed over the River Mulcair which was called Barrington's Bridge. Matthew moved out of Limerick city in 1818 and took up residence at Clonkeen House and took a lease of lands including Glenstal, Garranbane, Meentolla and Cappercullen on 1 I th December that same year for an annual rent of El 50.</p><p>Matthew Barrington finalised his holding by late 183 lwhen he paid thirty thousand, one hundred and ninety-three pounds, fifteen shillings and ten pence (E30,193,15s.10d.) for the Carbery Estate. This same year, he sought and eventually obtained the title of Baronet for his father, Joseph Barrington.
Knowing he was to inherit the title, Matthew Barrington built a new seat, Glenstal Castle. They considered building it in Glenstal but switched to a site in neighbouring Garranbane. But they confusingly kept the name "Glenstal" for it. During all this time, Matthew Barrington had his chief residence at Clonkeen House, just beside Barington's Bridge, on the Murroe side. </p><p>'Matthew made a considerable fortune as a lawyer for the county and the first Irish railways.
He also maintained a private practice as a solicitor both in Dublin and Limerick. This wealth enabled The Barrington family to establish a charitable institution for the relief of the poor of their native city which cost them in the region of €10,000.00. Banington's Hospital Act was passed in 1830. The sick were first admitted to it on 5th November 1831. In 1832 an outbreak ofcholera proved how invaluable this institution was for the citizens'</p>

        <p>C'Matthew Barrington finalised his holding by late 183 lwhen he paid thirty thousand, one hundred and ninety-three pounds, fifteen shillings and ten pence (E30,193,15s.10d.) for the Carbery Estate. This same year, he sought and eventually obtained the title of Baronet for his father, Joseph Barrington.

But they confusingly kept the name "Glenstal" for it. During all this time, Matthew Barrington had his chief residence at Clonkeen House, just beside Barington's Bridge, on the Murroe side. 
</p><p>It is no wonder that the area enchanted Matthew Barrington. Lewis (1837) described Barrington's Bridge as 'a village, in the parish of Clonkeen.. .on the River Mulkern (Mulcair).. .the surrounding country is fertile, and the scenery agreeably diversified and embellished with modern and elegant cottages and substantial farmhouses mostly with gardens and orchards attached to them. Though small it has a pleasing and cheerful aspect; there is a neat and commodious hotel; a pennypost has been established from Limerick, and it is a chief station of the constabulary police. A neat school-house has been built for a school in connection with the National Board, with separate apartments for the master and mistress'. At a short distance from the village is the ancient parish church, in the Norman style, the western entrance of which presents some very beautiful details. 'Having chosen his site on a commanding though sheltered height, he bought up some small farms to lay out a magnificent park, planted with exotic trees imported from America, Asia and Australia.9</p><p>By 1840 Matthew, his wife and their eight children along with an entourage of servants moved into the castle. 'Sir Matthew (having inherited the title from his late father in 1846) was an improving landlord and in all planted 600 acres of forest, reclaimed a vast quantity of land and was kind to his tenants. During the Great Famine, he gave his tenants a reduction in their rents and in many cases did not exact any payments.</p><p>In 1850 he gave a grant of land in the village of Murroe for the erection of a national school and provided the stone from his quarries for the building. The school opened in 1852 with Sir Matthew and his wife as patrons' 10. It was said of him that "his purse was open to all in need, especially when the call for help came from someone in his native Limerick"'ll </p>
          <p>Sir Matthew died on 1 st April 1861, aged 72 years and is buried in the family vault in St. Mary's</p>
