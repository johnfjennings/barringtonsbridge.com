            <h3><em>Barrington's Bridge, Co. Limerick</em></h3>
            <h4>Bicentenary Celebrations</h4>
            <p>Made by J. Doyle of Limerick in 1818. 'Erected by M. Barrington'. Sir Matthew Barrington was the landowner. This is a remarkable survivor, being a very early and rare example of a cast iron bridge whose arch ribs are assembled from lengths of flanged cast iron 'pipes'. This type of construction allowed the bridge to have a relatively shallow depth and low rise. The appearance is somewhat marred by the proximity of the adjacent concrete bridge. There are nine of these pipe arches, connected transversely to each other by iron plates. These are clamped between the pipe flanges, and extend the full width of the bridge. The pipes are 1 ft diameter, in 6 ft lengths.</p>
                <p>In 2018, the locals of Clonkeen, Murroe-Boher, Ahane, Castleconnell and Montpelier celebrated Barrington's Bridge bicentenary birthday.Troughs of beautiful flowers, kindly supplied for the day by Limerick City and County Council, adorned the bridge. They also painted it for the occasion. A giant banner and bunting added to the historic anniversary.

            <h3><em>Living Bridge, Limerick City</em></h3>
                <p>The Living Bridge (Irish: An Droichead Beo) is a pedestrian bridge across the River Shannon linking the University of Limerick’s premises in County Limerick and County Clare.</p>

                <p>The bridge was designed by Wilkinson Eyre Architects to provide social and cultural space to encourage pedestrians to rest a while as they cross along the gently curved structure. At this point on the Shannon it is wide and shallow with many wooded islands which provide varied views and support for the piers. The deck is supported by two underslung catenary cables. Financed through a Public-private partnership, construction was undertaken by Eiffel Constructions Metalliques and completed in November 2007 at a cost of €12 million. At 350 metres it is the longest pedestrian bridge in Ireland</p>
                
                <p>Inscription to commemorative plaque, on road side of parapet reads: 'This bridge was built A.D. 1840 at the Expense of the Corporation of the Borough of Limerick. This tablet was placed there by order of the town council A.D. 1843. The Right Worshipful Martin Honan Mayor John F. Raleigh Esq. Town Clerk Francis O'Neil Esq. Treasurer James and G.R. Pain Architects.' Benchmark inscription to side.</p>
