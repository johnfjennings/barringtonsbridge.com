            <p><strong><em>Barrington's Bridge</em></strong> is located approximately 14km from Limerick City, in the village of Clonkeen, also known as Barrington after the Barrington family of Limerick. Clonkeen is situated in the Electoral Division of Clonkeen, in the Civil Parish of Clonkeen, in the Barony of Clanwilliam, in the County of Limerick. Though famous for the 53ft, cast-iron bridge, it is also home to a Norman-style church and Glenstal Abbey which is the former home of Matthew Barrington, the man who commisioned for the bridge to be built, his wife and 8 children.</p>
