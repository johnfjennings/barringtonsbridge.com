            <p><strong><em>The Barrington Family</em></strong> is of Norman descent, having come from Normandy with the invasion of William the Conqueror. They arrived in Ireland through Samuel Barrington in 1691. They retained a high-ranking status in the city as landowners and were heavily involved legal matters and governance. The Barrington coat of arms can be seen on the right.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Matthew Barrington</em></strong> was born in May, 1788. He became a solicitor and worked his way up to become Crown Solicitor for Munster in 1814. Later that year he married Charlotte Hartigan who owned a large plot of land in Limerick.
                <p><strong><em>Matthew</em></strong> became interested in investing in properties around Limerick later in life. He moved out of Limerick City in 1818, leasing lands in Glenstal, Garranbane, Meentolla and Cappercullen, while he, his wife and 8 children took up residence in Clonkeen House. He commissioned for the bridge to be built that year to ease access between his residence and Limerick city, also helping out the other locals around the barony. He sought help from Limerick Iron Foundries (at the time James Doyle and Company, established in 1806). This bridge was the first iron road bridge produced by an Irish foundry. Matthew’s name is adorned on the side of the bridge.</p>

                <p><strong><em>The Barrington’s</em></strong> were most likely taken with Clonkeen due to the “fertile country side, the agreeably diversified scenery embellished with modern and elegant cottages and substantial farmhouses mostly with gardens and orchards attached to them” as described by Lewis (1837). They decorated their lands by creating a large park, filled with exotic trees imported from America, Asia and Australia. </p>
                <p><strong><em>Matthew Barrington’s</em></strong> immense wealth, created both from his time as Crown Solicitor for Munster and by keeping his own private practice as a solicitor both in Dublin and Limerick, also enabled him to give back to the poor and needy of his home city. It’s estimated they spent around £10,000 establishing their own charitable institution. He erected Barrington’s Hospital in 1829, with Barrington’s Hospital Act passing in 1830, first opening up to the public late in 1831. Fortunately, the hospital had opened up just in time to tackle the cholera outbreak of 1832.</p>
                <p><strong><em>The</em></strong> generosity of the Barrington family was not just limited to charitable work. As a landlord Matthew Barrington planted 600 acres of trees, reclaimed a vast quantity of land and was kind to his tenants. During the Great Famine (1845 – 1852) he vastly reduced rent to his tenants and in many cases did not request any payment at all. In 1852 he and his wife became patrons for the erection of a national school and provided the stone from his quarries. His purse was open to all in need, especially those from Limerick.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Matthew Barrington</em></strong> died on April 1st, 1861 at 72 years old. He is buried in the family vault in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Limerick.</p>
