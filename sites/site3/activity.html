               <h2>Limerick</h2>
               <h6>City in the Republic of Ireland</h6>
               <p>Limerick is a major city in the Republic of Ireland, set in Munster province in the south of the country. Its compact old town is known for the medieval-era St. Mary’s Cathedral and St. John’s square, which is lined with Georgian townhouses. Standing along the River Shannon, the 13th-century King John’s Castle is one of the city’s most recognisable sites.The Hunt Museum, tucked inside a stately former custom house, displays Limerick’s most well-known collection of art and cultural artefacts. The Limerick City Gallery of Art focuses on classical and contemporary Irish works, while local history is showcased at the intimate Limerick City Museum. Traces of the gritty Limerick described by Frank McCourt in his memoir, “Angela’s Ashes”, can be seen on walking tours outside the city’s historic core. Limerick is also a gateway to Lough Gur, whose shores are studded with megalithic tombs, and the historic village of Adare.</p>
