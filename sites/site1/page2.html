                <h3>Design Overview</h3>
                <p>Barrington's Bridge, a single span bridge, the first of its kind to have been built in Ireland in 1818. Commissioned by Sir Matthew Barrington and made by James Doyle and Co. The uniqueness of this bridge, for its time, was the use of tubular cast iron ribs. Nine ribs in total and each spanning rib is connected to all the others by a connecting iron plate. This gave the bridge great rigidity while offering a shallow depth and  a low rise. The nine ribs also offered a span of near 60ft and a width that was capable of allowing two carriages to run abreast or horse and carriages were capable of passing, on the bridge.</p>
                <p>The design of the bridge was a new concept to bridge building in general and the method by which it was manufactured brought some notoriety to its builder, James Doyle. The manufacture of the spanning ribs was made up of 6ft long pipes with a diameter of 1ft. Each connecting to the ends of the other by means of a flange where they were bolted together. The iron connecting plates were bolted in between the flanges to give the structural support laterally. These 6ft long pipes were cast to give a long low curve to the rib in turn providing a low arch at a 60ft span. Incredible engineering for its time and an incredible asset to the prosperity of the locality.</p>
